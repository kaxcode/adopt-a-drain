        %ul
          %li
            Dress appropriately. Wear work gloves, close-toed shoes, and bright, reflective clothing.
          %li
            Use a broom or trash picker to remove litter and debris from around the storm drain.
          %li
            Clean the drain only during daylight hours.
          %li
