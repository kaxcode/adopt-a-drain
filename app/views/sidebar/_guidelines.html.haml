          Thank you for your interest in adopting Norfolk's storm drains (also called catch basins). By
          pledging to keep your drain free of leaves and debris, you are
          joining your neighbors in helping to protect the environment, manage
          stormwater, and minimize flooding.

          To conduct a safe clean-up of your storm drain, DO:
        %ul
          %li
            Dress appropriately. Wear work gloves, close-toed shoes, and bright, reflective clothing.
          %li
            Use a broom or trash picker to remove litter and debris from around the storm drain.
          %li
            Clean the drain only during daylight hours.
          %li
            In case of an emergency, have a cell phone with you to call for help.
          %li
            Secure all belongings, like cell phones, so that they do not fall into the storm drains. You will not be able to retrieve them if they fall.
          %li
            Have separate bags for trash and recyclables.
          %li
            Close bags and place in your trash and recycling bins for regular pick-up.
        %h3
          To protect yourself and others:
        %ul
          %li
            DO NOT stand in the street while cleaning. Clean the storm drain from the sidewalk.
          %li
            DO NOT stand in the street while cleaning. Clean the storm drain from the sidewalk.
          %li
            DO NOT clean the drain during dark hours or inclement weather.
          %li
            DO NOT volunteer or perform any of these activities under the influence of alcohol and drugs.
          %li
            DO NOT pick up weapons or bullet casings. If found, call the non-emergency number at 441-5610.
          %li
            DO NOT pick up syringes or hypodermic needles with bare hands. Wearing gloves, an adult should pick up a needle with a pair of pliers or similar device; drop the needle in a hard-wall container such as a metal can or plastic bottle. Seal the container and place in the trash. (As instructed by the Norfolk Health Department)
          %li
            DO NOT pick up materials that appear to be hazardous or dangerous. Report graffiti, dumping, or spills to the Norfolk Cares Line at 664-6510.
          %li
            Although rare, “bottle bombs” made of plastic bottles do exist. DO NOT pick up any partially filled, closed bottles that appear to have metal or hazardous liquids inside. If a suspicious bottle is found, back away from it at least 100 feet, prevent any other individuals from entering the area, and finish your clean up. Be sure to call 911 to inform the police of what you’ve found and where you found it.

          Free Tools and Training
        %p
          We invite drain adopters to periodic events during the rainy season

          supplies. Please keep an eye on your email for notification of these
          events. You will also receive email reminders from the Norfolk Resilience to clear
          your drains when rain is expected.
